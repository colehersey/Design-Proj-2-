This project implements a digital vending machine in SystemVerilog that accepts nickels, dimes, and quarters for items costing $0.50. 
It handles exact payments, returns change in the largest denominations, and supports a synchronous refund input before vending. 
The design is clocked at 1 Hz and is validated using provided ModelSim testbenches. The project builds on my previous version used in Design Project 1.
